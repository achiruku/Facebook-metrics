# Facebook-metrics
Companies realized the ability and potential of social media to influence the customer and use it to leverage their business. Initially, social media marketing just started with publishing. Companies were sharing their content on social media to increase their website traffic to improve their sales. But nowadays, companies are using it more maturely than before.
For instance, a business that is worried about how well people are saying about the brand, would observe social media communications and respond to them appropriately. A company that wants to understand how itâ€™s performing on social media would analyze its engagement and sales on social media with a data analytics tool. A business that wants to target a specific set of the audience would run highly targeted social media ads. There are various social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, snap chat, hike, etc.
